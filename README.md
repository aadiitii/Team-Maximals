# PathFinder

PathFinder helps the mars rover to get to the destination through the shortest path while avoiding obstacles. It uses different algorithms to find the path and shows how they work. The Pathfinder allows the user to set hindrance or generate a random maze for the rover to get through. It has options to restrict the movement of the rover, allow or not allow diagonal movement or crossing corners. Once the algorithm finds the shortest route, it is illuminated in yellow. 

The pathfinder has the option of six different algorithms, A*, Dijkstra, Greedy Best First Search, Breadth-First Search, Depth First Search, Jump Point Search, along with their bidirectional. The bidirectional algorithms find the path from both the directions to meet at an intersection.
